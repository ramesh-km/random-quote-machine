# Random Quote Machine

Hosted with netlify at https://wisdomwithquotes.netlify.app/

A *React app* that shows random quotes every time you refresh or hit the new quote button. Also, the app includes a button for tweeting the currently shown quote.

These quotes are served from [a JSON gist](https://gist.github.com/ramesh-km/8a1b3a2cce4a8eff58ed83e40c491f35) holding all quotes.
